# Full Stack Mastery - Section 21: A Project on Backend with MongoDB

## Why JavaScript Cannot Be Used to Write Backend Directly

JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language, designed to run in the browser. It lacks the built-in capabilities to handle server-side operations such as file system access, database interactions, and network communications directly. To overcome these limitations, we use runtime environments like Node.js or Bun.

## Using JavaScript for Backend Development

### Node.js
Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It provides a rich set of libraries and modules to handle various backend functionalities, making it possible to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.

### Bun
Bun is another modern JavaScript runtime that aims to be faster and more efficient than Node.js. It also allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, providing similar capabilities to Node.js but with improved performance and developer experience.

## Why Use Express Instead of Node's HTTP Module

While Node.js provides a built-in `http` module to create server applications, it is relatively low-level and requires a lot of boilerplate code to handle common tasks such as routing, middleware, and request handling. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies these tasks by providing a higher-level abstraction. Here are some reasons to use Express:

1. **Simplified Routing**: Express provides an easy-to-use routing mechanism to handle different HTTP methods and URL patterns.
2. **Middleware Support**: Express allows the use of middleware functions to handle various tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.
3. **Extensibility**: Express has a vast ecosystem of plugins and extensions that can be easily integrated to add additional functionality.
4. **Community and Documentation**: Express has a large and active community, along with comprehensive documentation, making it easier to find support and resources.

By using Express, developers can focus more on building the core functionality of their applications rather than dealing with the intricacies of the underlying HTTP module.

## Conclusion

In this project, we will leverage Node.js and Express to build a robust backend with MongoDB. This combination allows us to utilize JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, creating a seamless and efficient development experience.
